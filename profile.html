	         <p class="indent">Hi my name is Aaron Salud. I like to do many different things. I enjoy playing guitar, longboarding, 
                 and studying. When I feel bored or lonely, I play my guitar to make myself happy. Music inspires me 
                 to play the guitar because for me, music makes me express my feelings and emotions to show who I am as a 
                 unique individual. I also inspired my friends to recognize the real types of music that are present 
                 in the modern time. Most music has their own messages and meanings but some music does not have a feeling 
                 and are mostly having more popularity than real music which contains emotions.  When I play my guitar, 
                 I always feel that everything is fine and it helps me feel relaxed.Longboarding or commonly known as 
                 "Downhill Skateboarding" is also one of the things that I love to do. It 
                 is a sport in which there are no rules to be obeyed except wearing safety gears. Longboarding is a freestyle sport. 
                 Longboarding is not a safe sport. Even though a long boarder told me that safety cannot be guaranteed even with safety 
                 gears, I still believe that I can act cool and unique by looking forward to try new things. I have been riding my 
                 longboard down the hills during summer with my friends. I also learn tricks like "sliding" in a very fast speed. 
                 Longboarding makes me feel free because it made me become an individual who likes to take risks, and a man who is 
                 confident enough to do things that I think are impossible. </p>
              <br><br>
              <p class="indent">Studying is also one of the things that I like to do. I like to learn new things that I have never learned before. 
                 In my opinion, studying answers most of the questions that I have in mind. I am always curious to know how technologies 
                 have been changing people's lives from the past and up until now. I experienced many failures in life, and I get depressed 
                 every time I do.  I just realized that studying makes me think wisely, and to feel confident enough to avoid chances of failure. 
                 I also like to study because it makes me become smarter to be able to make the best decisions. 
                 I am currently studying at Seneca College (York Campus). The program that I choose is Computer Programming and Analysis 
                 because I want to learn about different things that can be done with computers. When I was in high school, I took a class 
                 which is focused on electronic hardware which I found to be challenging to do, but it also introduced me to computer programing. 
                 I enjoy learning about computer programs because I want to understand the communications between people and computers. 
                 After I graduate, I as an individual will try my best to help and work with other computer programmers to improve software development, 
                 and to discover new ways to communicate with computers.</p>
